- [Current list of candidates](https://github.com/graphql/nullability-wg/blob/main/agendas/2025/01-Jan/29-nullability-wg-january-2025.md#agenda)
  in today agenda.
  - GraphQL Java PR feedback:
    - Not keen on names with parameters
    - Too generic
  - @noNullPropagation is slightly wrong. We propagate the error, not the null
  - Maybe @noErrorPropagation
    - Propagation is hard to spell
    - It’s pretty technical and long
    - Closes the enum route but we can add more directives in the future
  - Stephen: @nullOnError is short and descriptive.
  - Concern about choice and needing to take into consideration mobile clients
    that live a long time in production (eg. at Netflix 10 year timeline).
  - Benjie: not particularly keen on @nullOnError because it’s already what’s
    happening.
  - Calvin: @noErrorPropagation is double negative.
  - Benjie: @softErrors/@localErrors is also a good candidate.
  - Benjie: the boundary is a “position”, not a selection set.
  - @localErrors ?
  - Stephen: @allowNull
  - Benjie: @holistic/@semanticErrors
  - @allowNull is not very descriptive
  - Calvin: @allowNullWithErrors (possibly too nuanced)

## Implementation Handoff

- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4271](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4271)
- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/pull/1775](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/pull/1775)
- Alex: implementation of semantic non null for graphql-js is started, not
  finished.
- There are tests
- 90% there. It needs to be taken through the finish line
- Alex: problem about the printer. It is not described in the spec but needs to
  continue working. A decision has to be made what we are going to use there.
- Alex to continue being the champion and hosting the meetings.
- Benjie: might be worth taking it to the graphql-js working group.
- Is @semanticNonNull still a wrapper under the hood?
