- Benjie’s previous personal brainstorm:

- Currently we have a base type and a non-nullable type, ideally semantic
  non-null is additive
- Unclear if this will become the new default type, or if nullable will still be
  the sensible default
- Not captured in doc `!!`
- Another idea `-!`
- Evaluation criteria
  - Is this a symbol we might want for some other feature in the future?
    - Angle brackets and parens might come at a high cost in terms of this
    - “Preserve option value”
  - Needs to be something that we’re comfortable writing a lot and reading alot
  - One challenge with prefix is that it leaves more room for conflicts or
    invalid syntax
  - Non-ascii characters come at a higher cost. Might rule out some options?
    - Note: British mac keyboards don’t have a hash character
  - Syntax which qualifies the bang seemed more intuitive than ones which tried
    to build up a new syntax from the base type
    - The `~` and the `*` both work linguistically
    - (`someField!`) also captures “non-null but with error boundary”. This even
      matches an early conceptualization of how the types would be represented
      internally in the spec
  - We should favor syntax that is intuitive for the client (reader) if we have
    to trade off between the client and server perspective
    - For example,
- In general, we all prefer solutions which qualify the exclamation point
  - Feels more intuitive
  - Makes it easier to migrate a schema which has over-used non-null, however
    this is a breaking change
  - `!*, ~!, !^, !!, -!, !?, ?!`
  - `^` is commonly used for footnotes in Markdown, is visually less “heavy”
    than `*`
  - `~` is used as binary not in some languages which may imply a type of
    negation
  - Criteria
    - Is the order that one ought to use obvious?
- We arrived at a top three which seemed to pull away from the rest as clear
  leaders. `~!` is the favorite of the group, but all three are worth preserving
  and sharing with the larger group. All three have a basis in written English
  in which the additive symbol qualifies the ! in some way
  - `~!`
    - Interpreted as “approximately not null”
    - Might be slightly preferable during lexing (no need to look ahead) but we
      already do look ahead, so not a meaningful difference
    - ~ is used as “bitwise not” in some languages which may imply a type of
      negation (likely not a practical issue since most GraphQL adjacent code is
      likely not doing
      [bit bashing](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bit-bashing.html))
  - `!*`
    - Interpreted as “not null, with some caveat”
    - Visually too heavy in monospace
  - `!^`
    - Interpreted as “not null, with some caveat”
    - Harder to say aloud
    - Name may be unclear/ambiguous: “Bang carrot” or “Bang circumflex”
    - Often seen as a secondary “footnote” character to be used after `*` has
      already been taken. That said, commonly used for footnotes in Markdown
- Going from nullable to semantic non-null is a non-breaking change
