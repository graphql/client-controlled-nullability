## Results of the poll (Alex, 5 min)

- Alex: `?` wins
- Alex:
  [PR](https://discord.com/channels/625400653321076807/971515695881924621/1301066067791052860)
  with parsing changes
- Benjie: I was expecting that `?` would be a wrapper and `!` a wrapper. The PR
  seems to be building off of semantically non-null but will make aspects of the
  printer code less elegant
- Alex: Will take another look. Might be a little complicated
- Benjie: Asterisk PR (closed):
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1048](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1048)
  - This PR is better though:
    [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1065](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1065)
  - (But uses a different syntax again.)

## Resurrect #63? (Martin, 2 min)

- Martin: Opportunity to engage with the community
- Benjie: I am of the opinion that nullable should remain the default
- Benjie: I don't think we should re-open this issue specifically, but opening a
  new issue in the context of the semantic nullability discussions (i.e.
  semantically non-null by default) would be okay.
- Stephen: Even if we start a new issue, I agree it’s worth connecting it to
  this older conversation (#63) since it’s very much in the same spirit

## Next steps and action items (Alex, 15 min)

- Alex: Main WG meeting is next week. Should we bring blog post and PR and try
  to move forward?
- Benjie: Would like to see it written up fully? Otherwise, it’s here is the
  syntax we prefer but it’s not a fully formed solution
- Alex: I can do both of those
- Benjie: There is no difference for input in semantic vs strict non null. This
  may change for something like struct
  - For executable documents, (i.e. variables) we’d still use bang
    (non-null)/unadorned (nullable)
- Benjie: Some people have a bunch of `.graphql` files and concatenate them. If
  we were able to add document level directives, we couldn’t do that anymore
  - https://astexplorer.net/
  - ^ You effectively just build a new AST that smooshes together the
    `definitions` for each file.
  - Shame I can't share an example... But `type Query {  a: Int }` with the
    GraphQL language
- Alex: is this common?
- Stephen: Many (most) GraphQL servers at Netflix have multi-file schemas. Each
  file is not valid on its own, but they all parse on their own. So as long as
  we can still parse each file individually it should be fine.
